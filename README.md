# `.morinap`

This is my (updated) take on Dotfiles. This should be portable across both ZSH and Fish shell (the two I use), and it also supports more than just symlinking to my home folder.

Originally inspired by https://github.com/holman/dotfiles and replacing https://github.com/morinap/dotfiles

To install, simply run `./bootstrap.sh` in the root folder
